        <p>When I decided to redesign the website, my initial reasoning was to simply move our website to a better website builder. After taking a class about design method in spring 2020, I decided to apply the skills and processes I learned to make the user experience better.</p>
        
        <p>Undergraduate Theater Society is, first and foremost, an organization that provides theater opportunity for undergraduates. Ranging from acting to designing to theater administration to stage managing, and more.</p>
