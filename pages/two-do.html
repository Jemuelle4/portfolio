          <h2 class="text-center">Ideation</h2>
          <p>Once our group knew our users and the pain points that they have, we started brainstorming about features that we can incorporate into our app.</p>

          <p>There were many discussions as to how we should approach the app. Our initial discussion focused a lot on topic generators and love languages. However, we stepped back and read our "How Might We" statement again and realized that our initial idea did not properly address the pain points.</p>

          <p>Then we started talking about the topic of activities. During the discussion, it was also pointed out that a prompt generator is boring and overdone, but if we were to suggest activities, it would allow for better qualitiy, fun time. People doing activities together generates topics to talk about as well, as both person would have a shared experience to relate back to.</p>

          <p>With a clear focus, we started ideating using a prioritization matrix. Since we only had a day to design, we prioritized adding more high value, low effort features into our app.</p>

          </figure>

          <h3 class="text-center text-xl-left">Features</h3>
          <h4 class="text-center text-xl-left">Main</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Massive supplies of activities to show users</li>
            <li>Asynchronous browsing and planning</li>
            <li>Matching system</li>
            
          </ul>
          <h4 class="text-center text-xl-left">Secondary</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Activity indicators (time, cost, difficulty)</li>
            <li>Account system and user profiles</li>
            <li>Supports usage with different relationships (friends, family)</li>
            <li>Personalized themes/categories to reflect user's interests</li>  

          </ul>

          <p>Although the prompt is focused on Valentine's Day and long distance couples, we saw the potential and increased the app's scope to work even after Valentine's Day and to work for other types of relationships other than romantic ones.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Design</h2>
          
          <p>Once we had an idea of our features, we started designing a task flow.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center text-xl-left mt-5">Task Flow</h3>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="../img/Taskflow.PNG" alt="" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Figure 4: Our initial task flow</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure class="figure">

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Figure 5: A low fidelity prototype focused on the task flow</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>One important feature of this app is to ensure a way to interact without needing to sign up. We extensively discussed how users in general find it frustrating to sign up to a lot of applications without knowing how the app works first. Therefore, we wanted to provide a way so that the users can use the app without an account; asking them to sign up only after they are confident with the app and unlock additional features.</p>
          
          <p>This feature guided how we want the task flow to go.</p>

          

          <h3 class="text-center text-xl-left mt-5">Mid Fidelity Prototype</h3>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="../img/mid-fidelity.PNG" alt="" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" data-toggle="lightbox">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Figure 6: A mid fidelity of our app</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>We had a lengthy discussion as to how the users will choose their activities and opted to go with the all-familiar motion of swiping left or right (with a visual guidance to assist people who are not familiar with the event). With our main features, we aimed to address our three pain points. </p>

          <p> <strong>Pain point #1:</strong>  <br> Lack of interesting activties to engage in with partner</p>
          <p> <strong>Our Feature:</strong> <br>Our app's seemingly endless supply of fun activities means that users will never run out of things to do. After each swipe, a new activity will be generated. </p> 

          <p> <strong>Pain point #2:</strong>  <br> Difficult to schedule one-on-one time due to busy schedule</p>
          <p> <strong>Our Feature:</strong> <br> Our app is asynchronous which means the user can browse activities separately so they can enjoy them later, together with their loved ones.</p>

          <p> <strong>Pain point #3:</strong>  <br> Not up to date with partner's current interests due to distance and/or time difference</p>
          <p> <strong>Our Feature:</strong> <br> Our app's activity matching system allows the users to be on the same page with interests. If they both match, the activity is saved in their Two-Do list for later. </p>

          <h3 class="text-center text-xl-left mt-5">Branding</h3>
          <p>Our vision for Two Do is something that is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playful</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>Friendly</li>
            <li>Exciting</li>

          </ul>

          <p>This is reflected by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple, easy to read typography</li>
            <li>Warm, inviting color palette</li>
            <li>Rounded corners in our icons</li>
            <li>Modern 2D illustrations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-center">Reflection</h2>
          <p>Although we did not make it into the top three in this track, I consider this project a win for me. My first hackathon/protothon offerred a lot of learning opportunities for me. This protothon was the first time I worked in a group to design a product and it really opened my eye as to how much I have not learned yet and how much better it is to work in a group. As a student, I will apply the lessons I learned in my future projects and I will continue to learn to be a better designer.</p>
