          <h2 class="text-center">Ideation</h2>
          <p>Once our group knew our users and the pain points that they have, we started brainstorming about features that we can incorporate into our app.</p>

          <p>There were many discussions as to how we should approach the app. Our initial discussion focused a lot on topic generators and love languages. However, we stepped back and read our "How Might We" statement again and realized that our initial idea did not properly address the pain points.</p>

          <p>Then we started talking about the topic of activities. During the discussion, it was also pointed out that a prompt generator is boring and overdone, but if we were to suggest activities, it would allow for better qualitiy, fun time. People doing activities together generates topics to talk about as well, as both person would have a shared experience to relate back to.</p>

          <p>With a clear focus, we started ideating using a prioritization matrix.</p>

          <figure class="figure">

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Figure 3: Our final prioritization matrix</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Since we only had a day to design, we prioritized adding more high value, low effort features into our app.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <h2 class="text-center">Design</h2>
          <p>Once we had an idea of our features, we started designing a task flow.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center text-xl-left">Task Flow</h3>

          <figure class="figure">

          </figure>

          <p>One important feature of this app is to ensure a way to interact without needing to sign up. We extensively discussed how users in general find it frustrating to sign up to a lot of applications without knowing how the app works first. Therefore, we wanted to provide a way so that the users can use the app without an account; asking them to sign up only after they are confident with the app and unlock additional features.</p>
