            <p>Hello! I am an aspiring UX/UI designer and actor born in Quezon City, Philippines now residing in Seattle, Washington. I am a 3rd year undergraduate at the University of Washington studying Informatics: Human-Computer Interaction and Drama: Performance. I aim to combine my skills in theatre and UX/UI to design accessible and inclusive products that works for the people. My longer term goal is to design a product or a program that will open opportunities for marginalized groups to participate or pursue a career in theater. </p>

        <h2>How Does Theatre Relate to UX Design?</h2>

        <h3>Empathy</h3>
        <p>Empathy is an important part of being an actor. Through empathy, one can (or at least attempt to) understand other's perspective. Having acted in multiple productions, I have developed my empathy skills to better understand my character's and other people's perspectives. I can apply this skill in UX/UI design to gain users' perspective and conciously design products that will work for all users.</p>

            <p>My involvement in productions, students organizations, and committees requires me to work with a diverse group of people. Whether it be planning events for our community members or working on plays, collaboration is key for a successful end product. With my experience, I can effectively collaborate with different departments and stakeholders throughout the design process to arrive at a better product.</p>

        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
        <p> The first production I acted on was an improvised show. In improv, I am constantly adapting to the situation and its spontaneous nature. Improv also requires creativity and collaboration with others to make the scene come to life. I can use my skills of adaptability and flexibility  in design to respond accordingly to new and different circumstances.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p> In the rehearsal room, I am constantly looking for new and different ways to express lines through the use of tones and physicallity until I find one that best tells the overall story. Applying this skill of brainstorming creative ideas to design will help arrive to new and innovative solutions.</p>
