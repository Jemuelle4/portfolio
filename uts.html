        <h2 class="text-center">Why redesign the website?</h2>
        <p>When I decided to redesign the website, my initial reasoning was to simply move our website to a better website builder. Such a shallow initial reason. After taking a class about design methods though, I saw an opportunity to apply the skills and processes I learned to make the user experience better.</p>

        <p><em>The website is currently undergoing an overhaul to fix the design debt accrued when I first started this project. The user interface and user experience continues to be refined for this overhaul. This overhaul also brings better reusable components, naming conventions, brand guides, and other important things to make the incoming webmaster's transition easier. </em></p>

      <section id="research">
        <h2 class="text-center">Research</h2>
        <h3 class="text-center">Research Methods</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Website analysis</li>
          <li>4 one-on-one interviews</li>
          <li>2 online surveys</li>
          <li>Website research</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-center">Website Analysis</h3>
        <p>The old website provided information about our seasons and shows: what the show is about, when it is showing, and where to buy tickets. It was showcase-oriented. It lacked information about how undergraduates can get involved and what opportunities are available for students: our core purpose.</p>

        <p>This redesign aims to address that issue and make it easier for undergraduates to find information about the various opportunities we offer. The website also aims to inform interested individuals to learn more about theatre and the roles within the organization.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">One-on-one Interviews</h3>
        <p class="no-margin">Questions asked includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How did you find out about UTS? How did you find out more information about UTS?</li>
          <li>How did you stay connected with current events within UTS?</li>
          <li>What were you interested in doing with UTS when you first heard about them?</li>
          <li>If you visited the UTS website, what information were you looking for?</li>        
        </ul>

        <p>These questions were asked to understand what the community members are interested in when they seek information from people, websites, social media, and through other means. Ultimately, this information helps determine how to establish the information architecture of our website.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Findings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Participants indicated that they stay connected by reading the emails from the listserv</li>
          <li>Participants indicated that they use the website to try and find ways to get involved in productions and other events but have a hard time finding these opportunities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-center">Website Research</h3>
        <p>I decided to research multiple theatre websites to discover similarities and contents across the sites. I also looked into other University of Washington student organizations that focuses on community involvement and artistic creation. This process helps me inspire contents, website architecture, and creative designs that I can include in our website. </p>

      <section id="ideation">
        <h2 class="text-center">Ideation</h2>

        <p>Based on the initial research I've done, I determined that the main navigation bar should highlight the section where students can find opportunities to get involved in our organization.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="./img/uts-whiteboard.jpeg" alt="" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" data-toggle="lightbox">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Early ideation of the navigation bar and other contents</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As seen in the figure above, I almost forgot the "Get Involved" section because I got too carried away with the inspirations from looking at other theatre websites. Looking back at my research made me realize I forgot the section and engrained a lesson: <strong>always go back to the research findings when designing a product</strong>.</p>
      </section>

      <hr class="divider">

      <section id="prototype">
        <h2 class="text-center">Prototype</h2>
        <p>After ideating the navigation bar and pages that I wanted to include, I started making low fidelity protypes of how I want to lay out the information in each pages.</p>

        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="./img/uts-low-fid.PNG" alt="" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" data-toggle="lightbox">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Low fidelity prototype of the hompage and "Get Involved" page</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Based on the research findings, I decided the "Get Involved" page features different section of activities that students can participate in. This makes it easier to see what we offer reducing the frustrations of users and minimizes "giving up" when searching for information.</p>
        <p>Since participants indicated that they use the listserv to keep up-to-date with the current events, a subscribe button is placed on top of the "Get Involved" page as well to increase visibility.</p>

        <p><em>A high fidelity protype was not created as this website is created through Webflow.</em></p>
      </section>

      <section id="reflection">
      <h2 class="text-center">Reflection</h2>
      <p>I hope to incorporate web analytics and conduct usability tests so that I can further refine the website to have the best user experience. I suspect that my UX design skills is still shallow right now, so I may have to conduct more research and analysis to improve upon this website.</p>

      <p>This project is a good start in incorporating the lessons and skills I learned in my design thinking class. I hope to apply more lessons to this website as long as I am webmaster for this organization.</p>
