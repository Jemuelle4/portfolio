          <p>Hello! I am an aspiring UX/UI designer and actor born in Quezon City, Philippines. Apart from the Philippines being my home, I now reside in Seattle, Washington and I am proud to call it my second home. I am currently an undergraduate in University of Washington pursuing Drama: Performance and minoring in Informatics. I am the outreach director and webmaster for a student organization called Undergraduate Theater Society (UTS) and I've worked on multiple productions for the UTS as an actor. I also lead UTS Improv where I very much enjoy doing improv with community members and my friends.</p>

          <p>Besides being a student, I am also a part-time worker as a student coordinator for the International and English Lanugage Programs (IELP) where I took over our Language Exchange Program and led the student council to organize activities such as weekly English conversation groups and culture exchange. I am currently supporting development of a new program that will be offered by IELP in the future.</p>

          <p>The work I have done in my classes, student organizations, workplaces, and productions help shape who I am today and gave me skills and experiences that will help become a better designer.</p>

        <h3>Empathy</h3>
        <p>Empathy is an important part of being an actor. Through empathy, one can (or at least attempt to) understand other's perspective. Having acted in multiple productions, I have developed my empathy skills to better understand my character's and other people's perspectives. I can apply this skill in UX/UI design to gain user perspective and conciously design products that will work for all users.</p>

            <p>My involvement in productions, students organizations, and committees requires me to work with a diverse group of people. Whether it be planning events for our community members or working on plays, collaboration is key for a successful end product. With my experiences, I can effectively collaborate with different departments and stakeholders throughout the design process to arrive at a better product.</p>

        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
        <p> The first production I acted on was an improvised show. In improv, I am constantly adapting to the situation and its spontaneous nature. In addition, improv requires creativity and collaboration with others to make the scene come to life. I can use my skills of adaptability in design to respond accordingly to new and different circumstances.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p> In the rehearsal room, I am constantly looking for new and different ways to express lines through the use of tones and physicallity until I find one that best tells the overall story. Applying this skill of brainstorming creative ideas to design will help arrive to new and innovative solutions.</p>
