              <p>I am an aspiring UX/UI designer and actor born in the Quezon City, Philippines who now lives in Seattle, Washington. I am currently an undergraduate in University of Washington pursuing Drama: Performance and minoring in Informatics. I am the outreach director and webmaster for a student organization called Undergraduate Theater Society. Sometimes I do not know if we are going through what we want. But nowadays, we do know that there a thing called life and life is just one big piece of ball that you can roll up. And sometimes</p>

        <h2>Empathy</h2>
        <p>Empathy is an important part of being an actor. Through empathy, one can (or at least attempt to) understand other's perspective. Being a part of multiple productions, I have developed my empathy skills to better understand other people and their perspectives. I can apply this skill in UX/UI design to gain user perspective and conciously design products that will work for all users.</p>

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>My involvement in productions, students organizations, and committees requires me to work with a diverse group of people. Whether it be planning events for our community members or working on plays, collaboration is key for a successful end product. With my experiences, I can effectively collaborate with different departments and stakeholders throughout the design process to arrive at a better product.</p>

        <h2>Creativity</h2>
        <p> In the rehearsal room, I am constantly looking for new and different ways to express lines through the use of tones and physicallity until I find one that best tells the overall story. Applying this skill of brainstorming creative ideas to design will help arrive to new and innovative solutions.</p>

        <h2>Adaptability</h2>
        <p> The first production I acted on was an improvised show. In improv, I am constantly adapting to the situation and its spontaneous nature. In addition, improv requires creativity and collaboration with others to make the scene come to life. I can use my skills of adaptability in design to respond accordingly to new and different circumstances.</p>
