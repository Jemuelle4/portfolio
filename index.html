        <h2>Empathy</h2>
        <p>Empathy is an important part of being an actor. Through empathy, one can (or at least attempt to) understand other's perspective. Being a part of multiple productions, I have developed my empathy skills to better understand other people and their perspectives. I can apply this skill in UX/UI design to gain user perspective and conciously design products that will work for all users.</p>

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>My involvement in productions, students organizations, and committees requires me to work with a diverse group of people. Whether it be planning events for our community members or working on plays, collaboration is key for a successful end product. With my experiences, I can effectively collaborate with different departments and stakeholders throughout the design process to arrive at a better product.</p>
